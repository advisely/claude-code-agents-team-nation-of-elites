- **NEW (Recommended)**: Natural language - Claude automatically selects agents via Task tool
  ```bash
  claude "Design the system architecture for this microservices platform"
  # Automatically spawns solution-architect
  ```

  ```bash
  claude "Use @agent-solution-architect to design the system architecture"

### Benefits - Why Upgrade to v2 Plugin System üéÅ

1. **Faster Setup**: `/plugin install` vs multi-step manual deployment
2. **Auto Updates**: Plugin system handles updates automatically
3. **Better UX**: Natural language invocation vs explicit agent mentions
4. **Context Control**: Toggle plugins on/off to reduce overhead
5. **Discovery**: Browse in plugin marketplace
6. **Community**: Easier for others to find and install

### Migration Path for Existing Users üõ§Ô∏è

**Recommended for All Users:**
```bash
# Clone the latest version
git clone https://github.com/advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites.git
cd claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites

# Deploy (overwrites v1.x with v2.0)
bash scripts/deploy_agents.sh
```

**Alternative - Plugin Installation (when marketplace is live):**
```bash
# Clone to plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites.git ~/.claude/plugins/nation-of-elites

# Or from marketplace (when indexed)
/plugin install advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites
```

See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions and options.

### Breaking Changes ‚ùå

**None** - This release maintains full backward compatibility with v1.x:
