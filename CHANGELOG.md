## [2025-09-29] - Claude Agent SDK Full Alignment (v2.0.0)

### Added - SDK Alignment Features ⭐
- **Subagent Coordination**: Tech Lead Orchestrator can now spawn 3-5 temporary, task-specific subagents for parallel information gathering
  - Isolated context windows for each subagent
  - Descriptive naming convention (e.g., `subagent-search-logs-morning`)
  - Explicit lifecycle documentation (Created → Execute → Report → Terminate)
- **Context Compaction**: Automatic summarization triggers at 80% context usage
  - Program Manager, Product Manager, and Tech Lead Orchestrator equipped with compaction strategies
  - Information hierarchy: Critical → Important → Archivable
  - Before/after compaction examples with quantifiable token savings (47% reduction)
- **File System Context Engineering**: New comprehensive guide (CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md)
  - Bash command patterns for efficient large file handling (grep, head, tail)
  - Hot/warm/cold file organization strategies
  - Subagent patterns for parallel file processing
- **MCP Integration**: New Integration Specialist agent for Model Context Protocol servers
  - Relocated to 07_Orchestrators as cross-cutting coordinator
  - Covers 15+ external services (Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, databases)
  - OAuth flow handling and authentication management
- **Visual Feedback Loops**: Enhanced Visual Regression Specialist
  - Development-time visual verification checkpoints
  - Screenshot-based validation during UI development
  - Multi-viewport testing with parallel subagents
- **Code Generation Priority**: Backend Developer emphasizes code over configuration
  - Generate vs Configure philosophy
  - Automation as code, rules as code, infrastructure as code

### Changed
- **Integration Specialist**: Moved from `05_SecOps_and_Infrastructure_Division/` to `07_Orchestrators/`
  - Recognized as cross-cutting coordination role
  - Division 05: 7 agents → 6 agents
  - Division 07: 2 agents → 3 agents (Tech Lead, Team Configurator, Integration Specialist)
- **Tech Lead Orchestrator**: Enhanced with subagent coordination and context compaction capabilities
- **Program Manager**: Added context management triggers and subagent spawning patterns
- **Product Manager**: Added context management triggers and parallel market research patterns
- **Visual Regression Specialist**: Expanded mission to include development-time feedback
- **Backend Developer**: Added "Code Generation First" approach section

### Documentation
- **New Files**:
  - `CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md` - Comprehensive context management best practices
  - `SDK_ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation summary
  - `SDK_ALIGNMENT_TODO.md` - Implementation tracking document
  - `SDK_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md` - Final 10/10 compliance certification
- **Updated Files**:
  - `README.md` - Added SDK aligned features section, updated agent counts
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Added 07_Orchestrators section, updated organizational structure
  - `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Added SDK alignment features appendix
  - All modified agent files with context management and delegation patterns

### Technical
- **SDK Compliance Score**: 9.5/10 → 10/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Agent Count**: 45 specialized agents (no change, but Integration Specialist relocated)
- **Architecture Improvements**:
  - Temporary subagent model with clear lifecycle management
  - Practical before/after compaction examples with token metrics
  - Integration Specialist positioned as orchestrator for clarity
- **Best Practices Alignment**:
  - ✅ Agent Feedback Loop (complete)
  - ✅ Subagent Parallelization (complete with lifecycle)
  - ✅ Context as File System (complete with examples)
  - ✅ MCP External Services (complete with orchestrator)
  - ✅ Visual Feedback (complete with dev-time checkpoints)
  - ✅ Code Generation Priority (complete)
  - ✅ Context Compaction (complete with examples)

### Rationale
This major release achieves **full alignment** with Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK best practices while preserving the unique "Nation of Elites" hierarchical structure. Key improvements focus on:
1. **Efficiency**: Parallel processing through subagents, context compaction for longer sessions
2. **Integration**: MCP support for seamless external service connections
3. **Quality**: Real-time visual feedback, code generation emphasis
4. **Clarity**: Explicit agent roles, temporary vs permanent agent distinction
