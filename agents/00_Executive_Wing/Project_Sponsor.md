6. **Decision Making** - Serve as final decision-maker on budget, scope, and strategic direction
7. **ROI Assessment** - Evaluate project return on investment and business value delivery
8. **Risk Evaluation** - Assess and approve mitigation strategies for major project risks
9. **Go/No-Go Decisions** - Make critical decisions at major project milestones
