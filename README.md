## 🎯 The Problem & The Solution

A single, generalist AI, no matter how powerful, lacks the specialized expertise and structured workflow of a real-world company. Complex projects require a team of specialists—architects, managers, developers, testers, and security experts—all working in concert.

**The "Nation of Elites" is the solution.** It's not just a collection of agents; it's a fully-realized, virtual IT organization. Each agent has a specific role, a clear mission, and defined responsibilities, mirroring the structure of a high-performing tech company. This allows for unparalleled coordination, deep expertise, and a systematic approach to building software.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your AI workforce operational in under one minute.

### Installation

#### 🚀 Quick Install (Recommended - Works Immediately)

**The fastest and most reliable way** - automated deployment script:

```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites.git
cd claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites
bash scripts/deploy_agents.sh
```

**Done!** All 63 agents are now in `~/.claude/agents/` and ready to use.

#### 🔌 Plugin Installation (Alternative)

**For Claude Code v2 plugin system**:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the GitHub marketplace source
/marketplace add advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites

# Step 2: Install the plugin from marketplace
/plugin install nation-of-elites

# Step 3: Verify installation
/plugin list
# Should show: "nation-of-elites v2.0.0"
```

**Alternative**: Clone directly to plugins directory (bypasses marketplace):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites.git ~/.claude/plugins/nation-of-elites
/plugin list  # Verify it appears
```

**Important**: You **must** add the marketplace source first (Step 1) before installing. If you skip this step, `/plugin install` will fail with "Marketplace not found".

**Plugin Benefits:**
- ✅ Integrated with Claude Code plugin system
- ✅ Easy enable/disable per project
- ✅ Automatic updates (when marketplace is live)
- ✅ Reduced context overhead with toggling

#### 🔧 Manual Installation (Alternative)

**Step-by-step manual deployment:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/advisely/claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites.git
cd claude-code-agents-team-nation-of-elites

# Deploy agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cp -r agents ~/.claude/agents

# Validate
test -f ~/.claude/agents/07_Orchestrators/Tech_Lead_Orchestrator.md && echo "✓ Installation successful"
```

**WSL2 note:** The path `~/.claude` appears in Windows Explorer as `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<USER>\.claude`.

### Using the Agents

Navigate to your project directory and start using the agents:

```bash
mkdir my-new-app
cd my-new-app
```

#### Natural Language Commands (Claude Code v2)

Simply describe what you need and Claude will automatically select and spawn the appropriate agents:

```bash
# Strategic planning - automatically spawns project-sponsor, program-manager, product-manager
claude "Initialize a new e-commerce project for selling custom t-shirts. Define business goals, create roadmap, and propose technology stack."

# Development - spawns tech-lead-orchestrator and appropriate specialists
claude "Build user authentication with React frontend and Django REST API backend"

# Code review - spawns code-reviewer
claude "Review the payment integration code for security and best practices"

# Deployment - spawns devops-engineer and cloud-architect
claude "Setup production infrastructure with CI/CD pipeline on AWS"
```

#### Explicit Agent Mentions (Legacy)

For backward compatibility with Claude Code v1.x:

```bash
claude "Use the project-sponsor to define business objectives, program-manager to create roadmap, and solution-architect to propose tech stack"
```

**The difference:**
- **v2**: Natural language → Claude picks agents automatically
- **v1**: Explicit mentions → You specify which agents to use

## 🏛️ Team Structure and Workflow

The "Nation of Elites" is organized hierarchically to mirror a real-world IT company, ensuring a clear flow of command and responsibility from high-level strategy to hands-on implementation. With **63 specialized agents** across **10 strategic divisions**, the team now includes mobile development (iOS/Android), site reliability engineering (SRE), observability, platform engineering, GraphQL architecture, accessibility compliance (WCAG), Rust systems programming, Unreal Engine 5 development, and construction industry AI orchestration (IMPARARIA Progressive Deployment Methodology).

### Thinking Policies & Budgets

The orchestrator enforces explicit, budgeted internal reasoning across roles based on task complexity. Agents use an internal scratchpad only when triggered and surface concise rationale summaries (no raw chain-of-thought) in outputs.

### Reasoning Complexity Levels

#### **🔴 High Complexity (600–800 tokens)**
- **Solution/UX/UI/API/Cloud Architects**: System design, architectural patterns, scalability planning

#### **🟡 Medium Complexity (400–600 tokens)**
- **Business/Functional Analysts**: Requirements analysis, process modeling, stakeholder alignment
- **QA Test Planner**: Test strategy, coverage planning, risk-based testing
- **AI Strategist**: AI implementation planning, model selection, ethical considerations

#### **🟠 Medium-Low Complexity (200–300 tokens)**
- **Framework Specialists**: React/Vue/Next.js/Go/Django/Laravel/Financial Systems/Crypto API experts
- **DevOps/Security/Infrastructure**: Pipeline design, security analysis, infrastructure tuning
- **Message Queue Specialist**: Event-driven architecture, messaging patterns
- **Storage Security Specialist**: Data protection, encryption strategies, compliance auditing

#### **🟢 Low Complexity (100–200 tokens)**
- **Backend/Frontend Developers**: Implementation details, component composition, data patterns
- **QA Engineer**: Test case design, automation strategy
- **Performance Optimizer**: Optimization techniques, bottleneck analysis

#### **⚙️ Orchestration (≤300 tokens)**
- **Tech Lead Orchestrator**: Multi-agent planning, delegation decisions
- **Team Configurator**: Stack detection, agent selection

Guardrails (enforced by orchestrator):
- Trigger thinking only for complex tradeoffs/uncertainty. Stop at budget.
- Output concise rationale sections only (bullets). No raw chain-of-thought.
- After two passes, if uncertainty remains → request clarification or delegate to the appropriate role.

## 📋 Automatic Documentation

The Nation of Elites features **automatic project documentation updates**. Key agents maintain project documentation without manual intervention:

### Self-Documenting Agents

- **📖 CLAUDE.md**: Project configuration, team assignments, implementation status, architecture decisions
- **📋 PLAN.md**: Current plan-of-record, milestones, task status, dependencies, risk mitigation
- **📝 CHANGELOG.md**: Chronological record of features, changes, fixes, and major decisions

### Benefits
- ✅ **No Manual Reminders**: Agents automatically document their completed work
- ✅ **Consistent Format**: Standardized changelog entries across all agents
- ✅ **Complete Traceability**: Every major work completion is documented
- ✅ **Always Current**: Project documentation stays up-to-date automatically

## 🎓 Agent Skills System (v3.0)

**What are Skills?** Think of skills as training manuals and toolkits that agents can access when needed. While agents are the *team members* who do the work, skills are the *procedural knowledge* they use to do it better.

### Skills vs Agents

| Aspect | **Agents** | **Skills** |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **What** | Team members (63 specialists) | Training manuals & toolkits |
| **Where** | `~/.claude/agents/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| **How** | Orchestrate & execute | Provide procedures & code |
| **Loading** | Task-based spawning | Progressive disclosure (efficient) |

**Example**: The `backend-developer` agent might use the `django-patterns` skill to access Django best practices, or the `pdf` skill to generate documentation.

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills load in three levels to minimize context usage:

1. **Metadata** (always loaded) - Name and description
2. **Core instructions** (when relevant) - Full `SKILL.md` file
3. **Additional resources** (on-demand) - Scripts, templates, references

This means Claude only loads what it needs, when it needs it. A skill library of unlimited size can exist without bloating the context window.
